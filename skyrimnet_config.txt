# SkyrimNet VoxCPM Voice Configuration
# 
# For each setting, choose:
#   number    = Set your own custom value (experts only)
#

# CFG_SCALE: How Closely to Follow the Recipe
# Default: A great starting point.
# Voice sounds strained or weird? Lower this value. It tells the model to be more relaxed 
# and improvisational, great for expressive prompts.
# Need maximum clarity and adherence to the text? Raise it slightly to keep the model on a tighter leash.
cfg_scale = 2.1

# INFERENCE_TIMESTEPS: Simmering Time (Quality vs. Speed)
# Need a quick snack? Use a lower number. Perfect for fast drafts and experiments.
# Cooking a gourmet meal? Use a higher number. This lets the model "simmer" longer, 
# refining the audio for superior detail and naturalness.
inference_timesteps = 5


# Examples of custom values (VoxCPM defaults):
# cfg_scale = 2.0
# inference_timesteps = 10
